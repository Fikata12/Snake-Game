## Overview👀
  ####> This is simple Console game where you have to navigate the snake, by using the arrow keys, to reach and eat the food, which increses its length and speed, while avoiding making it "bite" its tail or hit a wall. 
## Food😋
The food is in three different types: 
- Asterisk 
- Dollar 
- Hash

The Asterisk gives +1 length, the Dollar gives +2 length and the Hash gives +3 length. The speed of the snake increses with every eaten food. Every food increses the speed with the same amount.
## Lose😔
If you make the snake “bite” its tail or hit a wall you lose and the following message pops on the Console: "Would you like to continue? y/n". If you want to play the game again you shoud type lower case "y" and hit Enter. If you don't, type whatever you want and hit Enter, "Game over!" message pops and the game ends.
## Win🥳
